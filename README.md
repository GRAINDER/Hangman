# Hangman
Fun Hangman game

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters one by one. The game has a limited number of attempts, and for each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn on the gallows. The objective is to guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn, or else the player loses the game.
How It Works
Game Rules

    1. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list of words. The word to be guessed is represented by underscores, one for each letter in the word.

    2. The player has a maximum number of attempts to guess the word. By default, this number is set to 20, but it can be adjusted as desired.

    3. The player can make guesses in two ways: either by guessing a single letter or by attempting to guess the entire word.

    4. If the player guesses a letter that is part of the word, all occurrences of that letter in the word are revealed. If the guess is incorrect, the player loses one attempt.

    5. If the player chooses to guess the entire word, they must type the complete word. If the guess is correct, the player wins the game. If the guess is incorrect, the player loses one attempt.

    6. The player wins the game by correctly guessing all the letters of the word before running out of attempts.
